Call by reference vs Call by value

Call by Value:
Copying the value using stack
thus, even if you change the copying value, original value doesn't change their own

Call by reference:
Copying reference to indicate locate of value

But, Python is not both call by reference and call by value
Python introduces call by assignment(call by object-reference)

If assignment is Immutable object then, using the call by value
or assignment is mutable object, then using the call by reference

Immutable: tuple, str, int
Mutable: list, set, dictionary

Conclusion:
Python's the way of calling the function is differed by object's data structure
